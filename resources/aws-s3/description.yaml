    # AWS S3
    Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

    The metrics for AWS S3 are obtained through AWS Cloudwatch. Using the [YACE exporter](https://github.com/ivx/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter). 

    # Exporter configuration
    ## AWS permissions
    The exporter needs permissions to access the resources from the AWS account. 

    First, create an AWS IAM policy on your AWS infrastructure allowing read CloudWatch metrics and get resources by tags. 
    Here is a AWS IAM configuration example:

    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "CloudWatchExporterPolicy",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "tag:GetResources",
                    "cloudwatch:ListTagsForResource",
                    "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
                    "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
                    "cloudwatch:ListMetrics"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    Then, create a file $HOME/.aws/credentials as the following, substituting the values with your key and password: 

    ```
    # CREDENTIALS FOR AWS ACCOUNT
    aws_region = us-east-1
    aws_access_key_id = AYYYYYZZZZZZ3BLXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = bXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ```
    ## Enabling requests metrics for S3 Buckets
    If you want to get the CloudWatch request metrics for the objects in a bucket, you must create a metrics configuration for the bucket.
    When enabled, request metrics are reported for all object operations.

    ## Cloudwatch billing considerations
    Using AWS Cloudwatch for monitoring can incur in additional costs in your AWS billing. 
    Check the [AWS Cloudwatch documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_limits.html) for further details. 

    # Metrics
    ## Daily storage metrics
    AWS Cloudwatch provides free daily storage metrics for all the buckets. 
    - BucketSizeBytes
    - NumberOfObjects

    ## Requests metrics
    By default, these 1-minute metrics are available at the Amazon S3 bucket level. You can also define a filter for the metrics collected using a shared prefix or object tag.
    - AllRequests
    - GetRequests
    - PutRequests
    - DeleteRequests
    - HeadRequests
    - PostRequests
    - SelectRequests
    - SelectScannedBytes
    - SelectReturnedBytes
    - ListRequests
    - BytesDownloaded: Average (bytes per request), Sum (bytes per period),
    - BytesUploaded: Average (bytes per request), Sum (bytes per period),
    - 4xxErrors: Average (reports per request), Sum (reports per period)
    - 5xxErrors: Average (reports per request), Sum (reports per period)
    - FirstByteLatency
    - TotalRequestLatency

    ## Replication metrics
    Only replication rules that have S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) enabled will publish replication metrics.
    - ReplicationLatency
    - BytesPendingReplication
    - OperationsPendingReplication


    For further information, consult the [Cloudwatch documentation on S3 metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cloudwatch-monitoring.html).

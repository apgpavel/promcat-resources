  # Installing HAProxy Ingress
  To install the HAProxy, you can use the [official Helm chart](https://github.com/haproxytech/helm-charts):
  ```
  helm repo add haproxytech https://haproxytech.github.io/helm-charts
  helm repo update
  helm install haproxy-ingress haproxytech/kubernetes-ingress
  ```

  # Configuring HAPRoxy metrics
  HAProxy ingress exposes prometheus metrics in the port 1024 of its pods. To be able to scrape them, we will need to annotate the deployment with the Prometheus tags for scrape and port:
  ```
  kubectl patch deployment haproxy-ingress-kubernetes-ingress \
      -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"prometheus.io/scrape": "true", "prometheus.io/port": "1024", "prometheus.io/path": "/metrics"}}}}}'
  ```
  After executing this line, the pods will automatically restart with the new annotations.

  Finally, HAProxy generates metrics for the scopes global, frontend, backend and server. This last scope usually have a high cardinality.
  To scrape only the other scopes, we will use this configuration for the prometheus.yaml configuration file of the Sysdig Agent.
configurations:
- name: agent-deploy.yaml
  file: include/agent-deploy.yaml

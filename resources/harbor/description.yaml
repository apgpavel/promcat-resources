    # Harbor

    Harbor is an open-source container registry, originally developed by VMware and now under the CNCF umbrella. Although many of us typically use
    hosted container registries such as DockerHub, Quay, ECR, GCR or ACR; when you need a self-hosted registry, Harbor is a great choice. 
    Harbor provides great features such as RBAC, replication and image scanning.

    #Prometheus and exporters

    Harbor doesnâ€™t expose Prometheus metrics natively (although there is an issue for it: #4557). But fortunately, Max Cai wrote a Prometheus exporter 
    that queries Harbor API and generates a bunch of useful metrics.

    ```
      helm install harbor harbor/harbor
    ```

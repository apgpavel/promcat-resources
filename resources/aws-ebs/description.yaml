    # AWS Elastic Block Store
    Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy to use, 
    high performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) 
    for both throughput and transaction intensive workloads at any scale. 
    A broad range of workloads, such as relational and non-relational databases, enterprise applications, 
    containerized applications, big data analytics engines, file systems, 
    and media workflows are widely deployed on Amazon EBS.

    The metrics for AWS EBS are obtained through AWS Cloudwatch. Using the [YACE exporter](https://github.com/ivx/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter). 

    # Exporter configuration
    ## AWS permissions
    The exporter needs permissions to access the resources from the AWS account. 

    First, create an AWS IAM policy on your AWS infrastructure allowing read CloudWatch metrics and get resources by tags. 
    Here is a AWS IAM configuration example:

    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "CloudWatchExporterPolicy",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "tag:GetResources",
                    "cloudwatch:ListTagsForResource",
                    "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
                    "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
                    "cloudwatch:ListMetrics"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    Then, create a file $HOME/.aws/credentials as the following, substituting the values with your key and password: 

    ```
    # CREDENTIALS FOR AWS ACCOUNT
    aws_region = us-east-1
    aws_access_key_id = AYYYYYZZZZZZ3BLXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = bXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ```

    ## Cloudwatch billing considerations
    Using AWS Cloudwatch for monitoring can incur in additional costs in your AWS billing. 
    Check the [AWS Cloudwatch documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_limits.html) for further details.
